The following files are now on the snsystems FTP site, and are
ready to be downloaded:

arridos.zip
firestar.zip
install.zip
karbonis.zip
korodera.zip
raltima.zip
rarridos.zip
rfirestar.zip
rkarboni.zip
rkoroder.zip
rsilver.zip
rterrama.zip
silver.zip
terramax.zip

The files beginning with "r" are rapier tracks, and once unzipped, ahould be placed
in the wipeout\newgraph\rapier\xxxxx directory.


Note: when testing, edit the "startup.ini" file so that the first number is the 
starting audio track number on the cd, and the second is the final track number.
This should cure some of the sound bugs.
